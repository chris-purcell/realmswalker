Summary:

## Curing the Axe of the Nine Hells

### Required Components:
* bandit boots (quest reward from new thalos area quest)
* firebrand (candlekeep catacombs run)
* a pile of red dragon scales (tchazzar run)
* ultima weapon (northern crater, ultimate weapon)
* shield of protection (quest reward from quija)
* uncured axe of the nine hells

Kill Gillentalis the Great Wyrm in Forest of Destruction. You can solo this mob with patience and healing scrolls/mass heal potions. Bring the ingredients to the far east side of Menzobaranzen and say "ready". The axe will be cured but a goblin will steal it before you can get it. Enter Narbondel, the light at the center of Menzobaranzen and find an up exit in the middle of a block of six rooms. Kill the goblin to claim your axe.
