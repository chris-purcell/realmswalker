Summary:

## Crafting the Hopebringer
### Required components:
*  an arrow from the bow of Eros
*  a warhammer forged of dark mithril
*  a dagger made from the alloys of the RoK
*  a pandora stone

The arrow is in Stonebow dale. It's a secret, so once you find it write it down if you have memory issues.
Take the arrow to Hephaestus in Olympus and give it to him. He'll spout the following:

Hephaestus looks up from his distractions.  
Hephaestus says 'This arrow, it is of my own devising.'  
Hephaestus says 'I forged this one among many others for Eros'  
Hephaestus says 'To bring love to those whose path it would otherwise not cross.'  
Hephaestus says 'Yet even love is such a trifle in a world with so little hope.'  
Hephaestus tosses the arrow into a pile of forgotten things.  
Hephaestus then turns to you again and smiles.  
Hephaestus says 'Thank you for the brief moment of rememberance.'  
Hephaestus says 'Before the Olympic gods fell from favor, I was quite a skilled metalworker.'  
Hephaestus says 'Some of the craft still remains, fleeting in power but it is there.'  
Hephaestus says 'If you would like, there is a weapon I could make for you...'  
Hephaestus says 'It is called Hopebringer, and may help a friend in need if you so desire.'  
Hephaestus says 'Bring me the following and I will forge Hopebringer for you:'  
Hephaestus says 'A dagger made from the alloys of the RoK,'  
Hephaestus says 'A warhammer forged of the dark mithril,'  
Hephaestus says 'And a pandora stone, to bind hope to the forged.'  
Hephaestus says 'I will be waiting.'  
Hephaestus returns to his myriad of golden maidens.  

As a *female* character, go to the rooms above the throne of Olympus and north (you won't be able to as a male) and open
the box (Pandora's box) to release the demons Sorrow, Vice, Misfortune and Disease. Hunt down and kill them all until you
get the pandora stone. Once you have the stone, take it, the dagger, and the warhammer back to Hephaestus and he'll craft
the hopebringer for you. Hopebringer is a leveler mace with the negating flag and can be very handy for leveler pk.
