### Required Components:

* a crimson ruby

Take the components to Guericke under the church in Longsaddle. With the components in your inventory, say 'reform the
gem' and he will take the components, make the gem, and give it to you.

You say 'reform the gem'  
Guericke says 'Looks like you have everything.'  
Guericke beckons for you to put everything down on his table.  
You do as he asks.  
You drop A smashed piece of jewel.  
You drop a crimson ruby.  
You drop a teardrop gem.  
You drop a Sunstone.  
You drop Solidified Lifestream.  
Guericke gets A smashed piece of jewel.  
Guericke gets a crimson ruby.  
Guericke gets a teardrop gem.  
Guericke gets a Sunstone.  
Guericke gets Solidified Lifestream.  
Guericke clamps the smashed jewel down in his vise.  
With steady hands, Guericke works out the gem fragments.  
He places each of these carefully into a silk pouch.  
Guericke then places the other gems into a silk pouch.  
Guericke grabs a nearby jeweler's hammer.  
Guericke strikes the sample of lifestream with it!  
Strange glowing green liquid pours from the crack  
Which Guericke gathers up into his silk pouch,  
Taking the pouch, Guericke places it in a nearby crucible.  
And casts it into a strange contraption.  
Steam pours from the pipes, scaring the people upstairs!  
With a turn of a crank, and a pull of a lever.  
A bright flash pulses from within.  
Guericke opens the crucible with tongs,  
Pulling forth a radiant gem of which there is no equal.  
Guericke says 'It worked!  One of the most powerful gems ever known has
been made!'  
Guericke gives you the gem of power.
