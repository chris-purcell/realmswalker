Summary:

## Curing the Cap of the Conductor (Ghost Cap)

### Required Components:
* chastity belt (forest of destruction, carnilla the slut)
* human skull helm (forest of destruction tower, the demon knight of chaos)
* forelimb claws of the tarrasque (4 diamond dungeon)
* decanter of endless water (quest reward from quija)
* light of power (quest request from quija)
* uncured cap from Ghost Train

Enter the Ghost Train in Zozo with a healer and at least one merc. Bring faerie/pixie wings for everyone on the run!!
You will need fly to complete the run and not get stuck, but you can't cast it. After killing the train, take the cap
and the rest of the ingredients to Stonebow Dale blacksmith. Give him all the items and say 'ready'. He'll 'cure' the
cap.

**NOTE**: the uncured cap is rot_death and the rot timer starts as soon as the train dies. Prepare the required
ingredients ahead of time and immediately relocate to Stonebow Dale and cure the cap to avoid losing it.
