Genly takes the spiked boots and places them on his anvil.  
Genly grabs a small hammer and begins beating down the spikes.  
One by one, until each spike becomes a large stud.  
With a hot shaping tool, Genly takes the largest stud and works at it.  
Slowly but surely opening it up into a deep socket.  
Genly drops the gem of power into the socket.  
And with the other hand, he pushes the Platinum Orb inside.  
Finally, Genly grabs his largest mallet and lifts it into the air.  
With a forceful swing, Genly drives the Orb and gem into the boot.  
Sparks shoot out violently into the air!  
Magic smoke fills the room as twinkles of arcane power glimmer throughout.  
And when the smoke and light clears,  
A pair of Platinum Studded Boots sit upon the anvil gleaming.  
Genly says 'Haha it worked!'  
Genly says 'With the power of the gem, both boots are plated in the platinum aura.'  
Genly says 'Both boots now have the power of one!'  
Genly says 'Enjoy your new footwear!'
