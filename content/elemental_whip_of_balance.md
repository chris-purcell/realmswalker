Find the Elemental golem in the hidden room in the Elemental Canyon and say 'bind the whips'. The golem will ask you for the items and create the whip:

You say 'bind the whips'<br>
The elemental golem Motions for you to hand over the items.<br>
You give a Crystal Ice Whip of Enlightenment to The elemental golem.<br>
You give a Sharded Fire Whip of Shadow Images to The elemental golem.<br>
You give a Winged Whip of Pixie Mischief to The elemental golem.<br>
You give a Stone Poison Whip of Watching to The elemental golem.<br>
You give a Spool of Binding Wire to The elemental golem.<br>
You give a yellow zircon to The elemental golem.<br>
You give (Crackling) a Weave Wrap to The elemental golem.<br>
The elemental golem strightens the whips and lays them out on the floor side by side.<br>
The elemental golem holds the Weave wrap out in front of him and the fibers unweave themselves in front
of your eyes.<br>
The elemental golem pulls the fibers of the weave out straight and lays them next to the Whips.<br>
The elemental golem lays the yellow zircon at the end next to the handles of the whips.<br>
The elemental golem stands back from the whips and begins to chant in a long forgotten language<br>
The whips float into the air and begin to weave themselves together with the strands of the weave.<br>
The zircon floats up to the end of the newly formed whip and touches the end of the handle.<br>
The binding wire unwinds from the spool and weaves itself into the new handle binding the zircon
tightly to the end.<br>
The whip blazes with a flash of blinding light as the golem's chanting increases in volume.<br>
When your vision clears the golem stands in front of you with the newly formed whip laying accross its
hands.<br>
The elemental golem says 'It is done mortal, and here is your prize'<br>
The elemental golem gives you The Elemental Whip of Balance.<br>
