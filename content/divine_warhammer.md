Travel to the Titan Village and find the armor shop, go down, then west to Draomar and say:<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'Man that mace you carry reminds me of an idea I had for a weapon....'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'If only I had someone to help me craft it.'<br>
You say [OOC] 'help'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'You would be willing to help me?'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'If successfull...  Creating this weapon would be the pinnacle of my career as a weaponsmith.'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'Keep in mind there is always the distinct possibility that I may fail.'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'Are you prepared for that risk?'<br>
You say [OOC] 'prepared'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'Excellent!  Then we will be needing a few supplies before we begin.'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'I will need the items on this list and that holy mace you carry now.'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'Come back and give me the list when you are ready.'<br>
You say [OOC] 'prepared'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'Excellent!  Then we will be needing a few supplies before we begin.'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'I will need the items on this list and that holy mace you carry now.'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'Come back and give me the list when you are ready.'<br>

Just hand him the list and he'll wreck your stuff!<br>
And if it fails, this is what happens (and you lose ALL the ingredients):<br>

You give Luminus to Draomar the blacksmith.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'Excellent now I have everything I need.'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith takes the coal and places it in the forge carefully.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith Finds the page in the book he needs and leaves it open on his workbench.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith moves over to the bellows and pumps them untill the coal catches and glows red.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith takes the Luminus and places it in the coals inside of a cauldron.<br>
The luminus melts into molten metal in the cauldron.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith takes the cauldron out of the forge and pours the metal into a mold<br>
The metal cools into a long thin plate.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith takes the metal out of the mold using his heavy leather gloves.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith takes the warhammer and places it in the forge long enough to burn off the moss and soften the metal.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith removes the warhammer with his tongs and begins to hammer the old weapon smooth again.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith dips the warhammer in a barrel of brine and sets it aside.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith pulls the sheet of metal from the melted Luminus and begins to hammer it into a thin sheet.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith grabs the newly shaped warhammer and places it in the center of the sheet of metal.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith bends the metal up over the warhammer and begins to pound it onto the head of the hammer.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith puts the head of the hammer into the forge and heats it back up to red hot.<br>
The new metal on the warhammer's head smooths out and conforms to the head of the hammer.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith pulls the warhammer from the coals and dips it once more in the brine.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith lays the hammer back on his work bench and steps back.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith wipes the sweat from his brow with his sleeve.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'Now comes the part where you pray for luck.'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith uncorcs the potion of Ressurection of Life and pours it over the head of the hammer.<br>
The warhammer begins to vibrate against the table violently.<br>
The head of the hammer begins to glow red hot and melts into a liquid puddle consuming the book with it.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'Its going to take me ages to clean that up!'<br>
Draomar the blacksmith sighs.<br>
Draomar the blacksmith says 'Oh well...  maybe next time!'<br>
