Summary:

## Curing the Cape of the Conductor (Ghost Cape)

### Required Components:
* tiny golden anklet with a ruby bell (menzoberranzen, shopkeeper)
* cloud hair spike (northern crater, cloud strife)
* power of the realms (quest reward from quija)
* cloak of the elvenkind (quest reward from quija)
* uncured cape of the conductor (ghost cape)

Enter the Ghost Train in Zozo with a healer and at least one merc. Bring faerie/pixie wings for everyone on the run!!
You will need fly to complete the run and not get stuck, but you can't cast it. After killing the train, take the cape
and the rest of the ingredients 14w3nwn7wn2w2n2w5s4w9s of Westbridge Market Square. Wear the cape, move west,
say "ingredients" and follow the instructions.

**NOTE**: the uncured cape is rot_death and the rot timer starts as soon as the train dies. Prepare the required
ingredients ahead of time and immediately relocate to mob or get summoned to cure the cape.
