You give the power of the Realms to Isaac.  
Isaac says 'Watch this!'  
Isaac takes the power of the Realms and secures it firmly in his vice.  
With strange gnomish tools, Isaac begins scraping and poking at the power...  
The radiant aura of it begins to pulse and flicker.  
Taking the gem of power in his free hand, Isaac lifts it into the air.  
With a foil-like material wrapped about the Realms, Isaac strikes it with the the gem!  
Blue sparks light up the room!  
Leaving behind a strange glowing lump of stone.  
Isaac says 'Hehe, now check this out!'  
With the lump still firmly secured in the vice, Isaac grabs more strange tools.  
Using the gnomish tools, Isaac begins to scrape, prod and poke at the lump.  
In one hand is a thin metallic foil, which Isaac wraps about the lump.  
The color changes from glowing blue to a faint white shine.  
Then Isaac grabs the second gem of power and lifts it into the air.  
With an even firmer strike, Isaac brings it down upon the lump.  
Arcane smoke bellows from the lump as if it were ablaze!  
Isaac wave his arms about, pushing the smoke from his face.  
Isaac coughs loudly.  
Eventually, the smoke clears.  
Leaving behind a beautiful white orb before which did not exist.  
Isaac says 'The platinum foil gives it the image of a precious metal.'  
Isaac says 'But only you know the truth: it is more valuable than measly platinum!'  
Isaac gives you a Platinum Orb.
